## Documentation

The project is Rest Api's made on **Laravel**, which retrives the data from the user and stores it in the database.

##	First Step
•	Make a new laravel Project.

•	Type => (new laravel project_name).

•	The new laravel project will be created in your system after few minutes.

•	Then open the project and start working on it.


##	Second Step
•	Link the project with github so we can upload the changes that we make changes repeatedly and save it online as a backup.

•	GitHub is a confirmation that our code exists as a backup if we need it again if something goes wrong.

 
##	Third Step
•	Get Done with the database.

•	Install the setup for the database if not installed.

•	After Installation of Database which will MongoDB, open cmd (Command Prompt) and check if the database has installed in our system or not by typing mongo on cmd.

•	If some action (code of lines) is performed, then you have successfully installed mongodb else there was some issue in the installation of mongodb. 

•	Then merge the database with the project so further there will be no problems with the database.

•	If there are some issue related to this go, see this MongoDB Documentation and video.
