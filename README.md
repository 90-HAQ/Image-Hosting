# Documentation

The project is Rest Api's made on **Laravel**, which retrives the data from the user and stores it in the database.



#	First Step

Make a new laravel Project.

    laravel new  project-name

The new laravel project will be created in your system after few minutes, then go in that folder and open it.

    cd project-name

Open project in VS-Code.

    code . 


Then open the project and start working on it.



#	Second Step

* 	Link the project with github so we can upload the changes that  we make changes repeatedly and save it online as a backup.

*	GitHub is a confirmation that our code exists as a backup if we need it again if something goes wrong.

* Go to github and create a new repositiory and then push your project on github so that you can always push your project after updation.

* These are the commands to link project with github.

        git init

        git add . or git add ['filename']

        git commit -m "My first File"

        git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git

        git push origin master


 
#	Third Step

* Get Done with the database.

* Install the setup for the database if not installed.

* After Installation of Database which will MongoDB, open cmd (Command Prompt) and check if the database has installed in our system or not by typing mongo on cmd.

* If some action (code of lines) is performed, then you have successfully installed mongodb else there was some issue in the installation of mongodb. 

* Then merge the database with the project so further there will be no problems with the database.

* If there are some issue related to this go, see this MongoDB Documentation and video.

* Documentation Link: (https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/php/).

# Deployment on Heroku 

- Heroku is a cloud platform as a service supporting several programming languages. One of the first cloud platforms, Heroku has been in development since June 2007, when it supported only the Ruby programming language, but now supports Java, Node.js, Scala, Clojure, Python, PHP, and Go.

- Here is the documentation for deploying app or website on heroku,

    - https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/reference

- First download the Heroku CLI Installer on your system.

    - https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli

- Get started to deploy your app / website,

    - https://devcenter.heroku.com/

- Create an App on heroku, and then start deploying your project on heroku platform.
